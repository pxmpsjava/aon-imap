# AON-IMap
- AON-IMap is a python script for validating a1.net or aon.at email credentials and inboxing specific emails.
  
## How to Use:
- 1: put your combos in "combo.txt" with email:pass format.
- 2: type "python3 aon-imap.py" to open the program
- 3: Only do this step if you are facing with errors -> type: "pip install -r requirements.txt" in console or install imaplib

## Attention:
- There are two versions: V1 and V2.
- V2 is way better for checking but requires SOCKS5 to work

## TOS
- I am not responsible how you use my development.
